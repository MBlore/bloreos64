ISR's have interrupts disabled on entry.
Next ISR doesnt fire until the ISR's has been ACK'd.

Interrupt prio:
    cr8 is compared with bits 4-8 of the interrupt vector, and if cr8 is less, the interrupt passes.
    0 lowest prio, 15 highest.
    If cr8==15 then no external IRQs are executed
    cr8 is only avaliable on x86-64
    Otherwise you can use the LAPIC's taskPriority
